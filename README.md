## Usage

In the project directory, execute:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please, refer to it for additional scripts.

## Configuration

By default it will load a demo Assistant. To use your own Assistant, set its code in the `App.js` file:

```
const cfg = {
    code:'HPTkH7GAWjx'
};
```
